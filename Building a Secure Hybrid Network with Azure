Project: Building a Secure Hybrid Network with Azure
Objective

Create a secure hybrid networking setup that connects on-premises infrastructure to Azure services, leveraging Azure's networking tools to ensure secure data transmission and access control.

Required Azure Services

Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)
Azure VPN Gateway
Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Azure Bastion
Azure Private Link
Azure DNS
Azure Load Balancer
Steps to Implement
1. Setting Up Azure Virtual Network

Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet):
Go to the Azure portal and navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Virtual Network".
Configure the VNet with:
Name: MainNetwork
Address space: 10.0.0.0/16
Create subnets such as:
Subnet Name: WebSubnet, Address Range: 10.0.1.0/24
Subnet Name: DBSubnet, Address Range: 10.0.2.0/24
Subnet Name: AdminSubnet, Address Range: 10.0.3.0/24
Review and create the VNet.
2. Simulating On-Premises Network

Provision a Simulated On-Premises VNet:
Create another VNet in the same or different region.
Name: OnPremNetwork
Address space: 10.1.0.0/16
Subnet Name: OnPremSubnet, Address Range: 10.1.1.0/24
3. Establishing Secure Connectivity

Deploy Azure VPN Gateway:

Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Virtual network gateway".
Configure:
Name: MainVPNGateway
Region: Same as MainNetwork
Gateway type: VPN
VPN type: Route-based
SKU: VpnGw1
Virtual network: Select MainNetwork
Public IP address: Create new, name it VPNGatewayPublicIP
Create the gateway.
Configure Local Network Gateway:

Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Local network gateway".
Configure:
Name: LocalOnPremGateway
IP address: Placeholder public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.1)
Address space: 10.1.0.0/16
Create the gateway.
Create Site-to-Site VPN Connection:

Go to "Virtual network gateways" > MainVPNGateway.
Select "Connections" > "Add".
Configure:
Name: VPNConnection
Connection type: Site-to-site (IPsec)
Local network gateway: LocalOnPremGateway
Shared key: Set a shared key for the connection
Create the connection.
4. Deploying Resources

Deploy VMs in Each Subnet:
Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine".
Configure each VM with appropriate settings:
WebServerVM in WebSubnet
DatabaseVM in DBSubnet
AdminVM in AdminSubnet
Ensure each VM is assigned to the correct subnet.
5. Configuring Network Access Controls

Set Up Network Security Groups (NSGs):
Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Network security group".
Configure each NSG:
WebNSG for WebSubnet allowing HTTP/HTTPS
DBNSG for DBSubnet restricting access to WebSubnet
AdminNSG for AdminSubnet allowing RDP/SSH only from specific IPs
Associate each NSG with the corresponding subnet.
6. Securing Administrative Access

Implement Azure Bastion:
Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Azure Bastion".
Configure:
Name: BastionHost
Virtual network: Select MainNetwork
Subnet: Create a subnet named AzureBastionSubnet with range 10.0.4.0/24
Create the Bastion host.
7. Accessing Azure PaaS Services Privately

Set Up Azure Private Link:
Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Private Link".
Create a private endpoint for services like Azure SQL Database within the VNet to ensure secure access.
8. DNS and Load Balancing

Configure Azure DNS:

Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "DNS zone".
Create a DNS zone and configure custom domain names for VMs and services.
Deploy Azure Load Balancer:

Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Load Balancer".
Configure:
Name: AppLoadBalancer
Type: Public
Backend pool: Add VMs from WebSubnet
Health probes and load balancing rules for HTTP/HTTPS
9. Performance and Security Testing

Test Connectivity and Performance:
Validate data transition between on-premises and Azure.
Ensure security rules are effective by testing unauthorized access attempts.
10. Monitoring and Auditing

Enable Monitoring and Diagnostics:
Enable diagnostic logs and metrics for VPN Gateway, NSGs, and other critical resources.
Set up alerts in Azure Monitor for suspicious activities or performance issues.
